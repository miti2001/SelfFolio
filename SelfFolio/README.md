# SelfFolio
Hey!
All students have some common things that they want assistance to, but do not have support. Some of such tasks include, 
tracking attendance, calculating their probable SPI/CPI when grades for some are out and some aren't, checking for plagiarism in their submission codes and budget tracking.

SelfFolio is a one-stop destination for all those problems. The features include:  
Attendance Tracker:- The student initially would enter the total number of lectures and when he attends a lecture, he just needs to add a present. 
The application would calculate the percentage of attendance that the student has giving them the idea about how many more lectures they can miss in order to avoid a penalty.  
SPI/CPI Calculator:- When only some of the grades are out, we start calculating the different possible SPI/CPI which we can receive for different combinations of grades. This is quite tedious. Here, you just need to enter the grades which you have, and it would give you all the possibilities with all combinations of the grades which you haven't received.  
Plagiarism checker:- Whenever you upload a code, you are worried that if might come of as plagiarised or someone might have plagiarised you code and just changed the variables/function names, etc. Here you can just upload your code and it checks for plagiarism against every one who has uploaded the code. This can also be used by professors to check for plagiarism.  
Budget tracker: Every month most students have a fixed budget. In the beginning of the month, many use it to party/order food many times and at the end of the are left with very little money. Here the person can enter their budget in the beginning and enter an expense whenever he does one along with the category, the tracker shows the remaining budget and also presents visually what the trend of expenses in the current month and compared to previous months according to those categories in form of graphs/charts.
